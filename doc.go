//Package cli provides some functions that make dealing with the flag package
//easier as well as some formatting functions for cli output.
//
//Cli is intended to be used by the command and subcommand subpackages that implement
//their specific use cases.
//
//See the command subpackage for writing CLI's that only do "one" thing.
//And see the subcommand subpackage for writing CLI's with multiple subcommands.
